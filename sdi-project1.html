<p>The theme I chose to use is my first deployment to Iraq. On the way there and once I got there I made a lot of decisions and some of them had consequences.This theme was kind of hard to do because of the flowchart but here it is. This is a very simple theme and describes the very basics of what happened in Iraq. Maybe next assignment I will be able to get more in depth.</p>
